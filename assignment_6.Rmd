## Assignment 6 - Spent a few hours trying to transform the data frame, but couldn't get it to work. Right now it's way too wide(430 columns) for it to be useful.

```{r sending-request}
response <- GET("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists.json?list=hardcover-fiction&api-key=Mf6q45GOp16AVREtOZMcsnFIO0jcUHcm")

data = fromJSON(rawToChar(response$content))

content <- response$content

char <- rawToChar(content)

books_text <- fromJSON(char)

lists <- books_text$results

list_df <- as.data.frame(lists)

list_df
```
